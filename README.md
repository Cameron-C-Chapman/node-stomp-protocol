# STOMP Protocol for NodeJS

An implementation of the [STOMP Protocol](https://stomp.github.io/) for NodeJS, both client-side & server-side. It does not implement a fully functional broker, but it's intended as an API for building complex asynchronous applications based on the STOMP protocol.

## Ready for TypeScript

I developed this module using Typescript and the npm package is already provided with `d.ts` typings.

## Installation

Run npm to install the package:

```shell
npm install node-stomp-protocol --save
```

Import the module using the standard syntax:

```typescript
import * as stomp from 'node-stomp-protocol';
```

## Usage

Work in progress.
